## Find Tunes: Discogs(tm) collection searcher

Discogs provides track names and credits for most music releases, but you cannot search their db by a track name or a credit.

This project will store that data for your collection in a local Postgresql db, which can then be queried by track or musician.

Written in CPython 3.10.
